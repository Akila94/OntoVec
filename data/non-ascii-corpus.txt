As, B, Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb, Mn, Hg, Ni, Tl and Se by using
Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The results were compared
against the drinking-water standards set by the WHO. Mercury (Hg) and Tl were not
recorded in the water samples. Lower reaches of rive Mahaweli from Peradeniya was
comparatively more contaminated than the upper reaches. In Ralkuli Ferry and Upparu
Ferry, the trace elements such as B (25,012 ± 3,446.5 ppb and 19,867 ± 4,991.5 ppb,
respectively), Cu (10,211 ± 1,079 ppb and 8,251.9 ± 3,862.80 ppb, respectively), As
(233.5 ± 26.7 ppb and 298.6 ± 44.7 ppb, respectively) and Se (1,361.1 ± 144.3 ppb and
1,558.2 ± 18.0 ppb, respectively) were significantly higher than the other locations and
exceed the WHO permissible levels.
